An _ works by reducing the amount of activation energy to start the reaction : enzyme
Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside the _ of living things : cells
During a chemical reaction, the _ are used up to create the products : reactants
_ reactions in organisms are called catabolic reactions : exothermic
_ energy provides the push needed to start a chemical reaction : activation
Your _ includes both exothermic and endothermic reactions : energy
A chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of _ : bonds
In a chemical reaction, all matter is _ : conserved
Energy can be released during a chemical reaction in the form of _ and light : heat
In a chemical reaction, there is the same amount of each _ in the products as there was in the reactants : atoms
An _ reaction builds up molecules from smaller ones : anabolic
All chemical reactions need _ to get started : activation
A substance that forms as a result of a chemical is called a reactant : F
Only some chemical reactions need energy to get started : T
Biochemical reactions take place inside the cells : T
A chemical reaction that releases heat is an exothermic reaction : T
Most biochemical reactions need help to get started : T
Anabolic reactions give off energy : F
Metabolism is teh sum of all the biochemical reactions in an organism : T
In a chemical reaction the quantity of an element may change : F
During a chemical reaction some bonds break and new bonds form : T
Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction : T
An enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy : T
In a chemical reaction, the number of atoms on one side of the arrow may differ from the number of atoms on the other side : T
Matter is always conserved : T
Understanding chemistry is needed to understand fully the processes within the cell : T
In a chemical reaction the quantity of each element does not change : T
